# Generated Tests
Test build configuration provides a generated test run via TeamCity Service Messages interface.
The number of tests to be generated can be adjusted in the Test build configuration's system properties:
 - system.ALL_TESTS_NUM - total number of tests to be generated. 
 - system.FAILED_TESTS_PERCENTAGE - percentage of failed tests in the run without % sign (i.e. 30 - means 30% from the total number of tests).
 - system.TEST_LOG_LINES_NUM - number of log lines to be generated for each test output (i.e. 500)
